Given multiple repositories containing Redis and Kafka code,
When analyzing various approaches to build a single container image (e.g., using multi-stage Dockerfile, custom S2I, or other techniques),
Then the analysis should identify the most efficient, modular, and scalable method, ensuring flexible configuration to enable Redis, Kafka, or both, while documenting the process, challenges, and recommendations.

This analysis aims to explore various approaches to build a single container image from multiple repositories containing Redis and Kafka code. The focus will be on evaluating methods like multi-stage Dockerfile, custom S2I, and other feasible techniques to achieve efficiency, modularity, and scalability

Research and Analyze Image-Building Methods
Investigate different techniques to create a single container image from multiple repositories, including multi-stage Dockerfile and custom S2I.
Assess each method based on criteria such as efficiency, modularity, scalability, and ease of configuration.

The analysis identified multiple approaches to build a single container image from multiple repositories:

Custom S2I with Additional Sources in bc.yaml:

This method allows combining source repositories during the build process by adding additional sources in the bc.yaml file.
However, this approach is not feasible in our organization due to policy restrictions.
Multi-Stage Dockerfile:

This approach uses a multi-stage build to efficiently combine components from multiple repositories.
The Redis and Kafka code will be fetched and built in separate stages, ensuring proper segregation of build and runtime dependencies.
The final stage will copy the necessary artifacts, creating a lightweight image that includes only the required runtime components.
Flexible configurations will be implemented to enable Redis, Kafka, or both through a YAML-based setup.


Create Multi-Stage Dockerfile for Redis and Kafka Integration

Develop a multi-stage Dockerfile that fetches and builds Redis and Kafka components from their respective repositories.
Ensure that each component is isolated in separate stages to optimize build and runtime efficiency.
The final stage should copy only the necessary runtime components to create a lightweight image.

Story Closure Comments

As part of this analysis, we explored multiple approaches to create a single container image from multiple repositories:
	1.	Custom S2I:
	•	While this approach allows customization through the assemble script, organizational restrictions prevent us from modifying the assemble script to achieve the desired result.
	2.	Multi-Stage Dockerfile:
	•	We successfully created a multi-stage Dockerfile that clones and builds the source code for Redis and Kafka within the container.
	•	This approach aligns well with modularity and efficiency goals.

Issues Identified:
	•	We faced challenges installing Git binaries (Linux) inside the container.
	•	Additionally, cloning repositories without using nbkid proved problematic.

We will continue working on resolving these issues in upcoming sprints to achieve the objective of creating a single container image from multiple repositories.

Note: During the analysis, we also evaluated an alternate approach to consolidate multiple components into a single repository. This method offers flexibility for deploying specific components as per user inputs and will be considered as a parallel solution if needed.

	•	Given the Kubernetes team is managing multiple components like Dapr across multiple repositories, frequently making cross-component changes, managing independent CI/CD pipelines, and preparing for team and project scalability,
	•	When evaluating the repository structure to ensure efficient updates, coordinated changes, streamlined CI/CD processes, and support for team growth,
	•	Then assess how mono-repo and multi-repo approaches handle shared dependencies, cross-repository coordination, pipeline complexity, and scalability for larger teams and projects.
