Given multiple repositories containing Redis and Kafka code,
When analyzing various approaches to build a single container image (e.g., using multi-stage Dockerfile, custom S2I, or other techniques),
Then the analysis should identify the most efficient, modular, and scalable method, ensuring flexible configuration to enable Redis, Kafka, or both, while documenting the process, challenges, and recommendations.

This analysis aims to explore various approaches to build a single container image from multiple repositories containing Redis and Kafka code. The focus will be on evaluating methods like multi-stage Dockerfile, custom S2I, and other feasible techniques to achieve efficiency, modularity, and scalability
