When a ServiceMonitor is deployed and Prometheus is configured
Then Prometheus should successfully scrape the metrics and Alertmanager should trigger notifications based on defined alert rules

Tasks:
Configure ServiceMonitor to pipe metrics to Prometheus

Define a ServiceMonitor object targeting the app service exposing /prometheus/metrics

Validate that metrics are successfully scraped and visible in Prometheus UI

Create an alert and configure notification in Alertmanager

Define alerting rules based on application metrics (e.g., high error rate, latency)

Configure Alertmanager to send alerts to a predefined channel (e.g., email, Slack, webhook)

Validate alert firing and notification delivery with a test case
