To accomplish your goal‚Äîhaving a Python agent (using LangChain, FastMCP server, and a Spring Boot app) that responds to prompts like ‚Äúhey there hit hello world‚Äù from VS Code Copilot and triggers your Spring Boot endpoint‚Äîhere‚Äôs a practical step-by-step solution, including key code snippets and architectural explanation.

## 1. Spring Boot: Expose a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù Endpoint

Make sure your Spring Boot app exposes a simple REST endpoint, such as:

```java
@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String helloWorld() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```
This will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/hello`.

## 2. FastMCP: Create a Python MCP Server

You‚Äôll need to create an MCP server using FastMCP and define a tool that calls your Spring Boot endpoint. Install FastMCP if you haven‚Äôt already:

```bash
pip install fastmcp
```

**MCP Server Example (`my_mcp_server.py`):**

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
import requests

mcp = FastMCP(name="HelloWorldMCPServer")

@mcp.tool
def hit_springboot_hello() -> str:
    """
    Calls the SpringBoot hello world endpoint and returns the response.
    """
    resp = requests.get("http://localhost:8080/hello")
    return resp.text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```
- The `hit_springboot_hello` tool will proxy your request to the Spring Boot app and return the result[1].

## 3. LangChain: Agent that Uses MCP Tool

Now, write a LangChain agent that connects to the MCP server and calls its tool when prompted. Make sure you use the `langchain-mcp-adapters`[2]. Here‚Äôs how you can structure the client:

**Install adapters:**

```bash
pip install langchain-mcp-adapters langchain-openai
```

**Create the agent (`agent_client.py`):**

```python
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client
from langchain_mcp_adapters.tools import load_mcp_tools
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")  # Can be adjusted per your workspace config

server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="python",
    args=["my_mcp_server.py"],
)

async def run_agent(prompt):
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)
            agent = create_react_agent(model, tools)
            agent_response = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": prompt})
            return agent_response

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "hey there hit hello world"
    result = asyncio.run(run_agent(prompt))
    print(result)
```

- This agent will run the MCP tool when your prompt matches (or can be routed with custom logic, e.g., via a tool name for ‚Äúhit hello world‚Äù)‚Äîand get the ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù from your Spring app[2].

## 4. Architecture Flow

1. **User Prompt**: In VS Code Copilot chat, the user types ‚Äúhey there hit hello world.‚Äù
2. **LLM Agent**: LangChain agent receives the prompt, determines the correct tool (based on intent/tool selection), and triggers the MCP tool.
3. **MCP Server**: The MCP tool function (in Python) is called‚Äîthis does an HTTP request to your Spring Boot endpoint.
4. **Spring Boot App**: Responds with ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù.
5. **Agent Output**: The response is routed all the way back and can be shown in your IDE or wherever you wish[2][1].

## 5. Tips for Further Customization

- You can add more tools to your FastMCP server for different endpoints or prompts.
- Use request/response logging as needed for debugging.
- Secure your endpoints for production use.

This approach uses only LangChain ecosystem libraries, FastMCP for tool bridging, and integrates cleanly with your existing Spring Boot app. You can trigger this from Copilot Chat, any custom UI, or an automated workflow[1][2].
