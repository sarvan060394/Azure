Deliverables for Year-End Self Evaluation
	•	Delivered a POC for building single container images using Python multistage Docker to optimize image size and efficiency.
	•	Performed analysis and created multi-feature container images to support KUBES capabilities.
	•	Conducted KUBES performance testing, including stress and load testing for Kafka REST Proxy and KUBES Proxy services.
	•	Enabled Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) for KUBES applications to optimize resource utilization.
	•	Enabled SSL for KUBES applications to enhance security and supported production deployment.
	•	Implemented KUBES container startup sequence, ensuring all auxiliary components are up before starting the application container.
	•	Fine-tuned compute resource configurations for Kafka Producer deployments and performed POD T-shirt sizing for optimized resource management.
	•	Developed a solution to persist Prometheus metrics for KUBE REST Proxy to ensure metric continuity.
	•	Implemented Resource Service Monitor to handle failures, monitor sidecar state for restarts, and improve service resilience.
	•	Delivered a Redis cluster setup and resolved cluster creation issues to improve deployment stability.
	•	Performed POC for generating heap dumps for Java applications with the support of the CTI team.
	•	Guided and supported the team for all platform-related troubleshooting and issue resolution.
	•	Contributed to the CML event for the Green Engineering contest, implemented CodeCarbon in the bank’s Jenkins pipeline, and calculated carbon emissions for pipeline stages.
	•	Supported production deployments by ensuring resource stability, optimized configurations, and continuous monitoring solutions.
