Description:
As a platform engineer, I want to analyze and implement a strategy for using a MonoRepo structure to package multiple components into a single container image. This analysis should focus on handling multiple JAR files generated by different Maven modules and consolidating them into a single location using a parent pom.xml file. This will ensure that all required JAR files are copied and included in the final image build process.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given a MonoRepo with multiple Maven modules,
When the parent pom.xml is configured to aggregate the artifacts (JARs) from all modules,
Then all JAR files should be copied into a single specified directory (e.g., /target/aggregated-jars) to be packaged into a container image.

 Research and Configure Parent POM for Aggregation

Analyze how to configure the parent pom.xml to handle multiple module builds and consolidate all JAR files in a single location.
Update the parent pom.xml with a Maven plugin (e.g., maven-dependency-plugin or maven-assembly-plugin) to copy all JAR files to a target directory.



# Stage 1: Use Python to fetch the source code
FROM python:3.10-slim AS builder

# Install required Python libraries
RUN pip install requests

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /workspace

# Copy the Python script
COPY clone_bitbucket_zip.py .

# Set environment variables for credentials
ARG BITBUCKET_USERNAME
ARG BITBUCKET_PASSWORD
ENV BITBUCKET_USERNAME=${BITBUCKET_USERNAME}
ENV BITBUCKET_PASSWORD=${BITBUCKET_PASSWORD}

# Run the Python script to clone repositories
RUN python clone_bitbucket_zip.py

# Stage 2: Build JARs using OpenJDK
FROM openjdk:11-jdk-slim AS app_builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /workspace

# Copy the source code from the first stage
COPY --from=builder /workspace/source_code /workspace/source_code

# Build repository_x and repository_y using Gradle
RUN cd /workspace/source_code/repo_x && ./gradlew build && \
    mkdir -p /deployment/x/jar && \
    cp build/libs/*.jar /deployment/x/jar/

RUN cd /workspace/source_code/repo_y && ./gradlew build && \
    mkdir -p /deployment/y/jar && \
    cp build/libs/*.jar /deployment/y/jar/

# Final stage: Produce minimal image with only the JARs
FROM openjdk:11-jdk-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy built JAR files
COPY --from=app_builder /deployment/x/jar /deployment/x/jar
COPY --from=app_builder /deployment/y/jar /deployment/y/jar

CMD ["java", "-version"]
